# Whateverbook

### Introduction

Today you're going to be making a Facebook for Whatevers. Twitter for birds, tinder for slumlords, snapchat for abstract impressionists. You can name it whatever you want: Dinosaurbook, thegoodbook, bookbook... The content here is totally up to you!


### But we're not logged in!

That's more of a Term 2, back end thing. You'll be designing the admin page, for those who run Whateverbook.


### Goals

We want to be able to:

* Display all Whatevers.
* Add a Whatever.
* Delete a Whatever.
* Make a Whatever linked (friends?) with another Whatever.


### How should we do it?

You should do it... well.

At this point, you should be able to take this piece by piece in an autonomous way.

But let's walk through some recommendations:

* Do the goals in the above section in their given order. Displaying is easy! Changing is harder.
* Focus on small things first. What form should your templates take? What should your data look like? Can you display one piece of data? Once you can do that, can you display all of the items from your data? Growing out this app bit by bit is the way to go!

And here are some tools we recommend:

* `HTML Templates`. You can see an example [here](https://github.com/abbreviatedman/web-component-play), and there are [basic specs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/template) and a [good tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_templates_and_slots) at MDN (with some things you can use to go beyond vanilla templates!), and a pretty good [blog post](https://blog.teamtreehouse.com/creating-reusable-markup-with-the-html-template-element) about them at Treehouse.
* Bootstrap, Material UI, Semantic UI, and any other custom component set. A good way to do something like this is to rapidly iterate without working on your own custom components, and then, when you've got it working, think about the design and customization of those components. With templates, it's very easy to switch things out!
